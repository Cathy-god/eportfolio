        <h2>Week 1: Foundations & Team Decisions</h2>
        <p><strong>Key Components of Week One:</strong> Explored fundamental concepts such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), design thinking, problem framing, and hypothesis testing. Applied models like the Problem Tree Analysis and Lean Startup methodology.</p>
        <p><strong>Team Decision-Making:</strong> Our team selected a problem through structured brainstorming and multi-voting. My contribution involved researching food insecurity and presenting data on its social impact.</p>
        <p><strong>New Learnings & Reflections:</strong> Gained insights into how defining a clear problem statement influences the success of a solution. Learned the importance of empathy mapping when designing user-centered solutions.</p>
